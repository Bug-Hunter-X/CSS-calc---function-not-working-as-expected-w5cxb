The issue might stem from a missing or incorrect unit in the subtracted value.  `calc()` requires consistent units within the expression. Always ensure the units are specified correctly. Here's a corrected version:

```css
#myElement {
  width: calc(100vw - 20px);
}
```

If this doesn't resolve the problem, there might be another CSS rule or JavaScript interfering with the element's width. Check for conflicting styles or JavaScript manipulating the element's dimensions.  Inspect the element in the browser's developer tools to see what computed styles are applied.
