# CSS calc() Issue

This repository demonstrates a problem with the `calc()` function in CSS. The goal is to set the width of an element to the viewport width minus 20 pixels.  However, the calculation does not work as expected. The `bug.css` file contains the problematic code, and `bugSolution.css` offers a potential solution (if one exists).
