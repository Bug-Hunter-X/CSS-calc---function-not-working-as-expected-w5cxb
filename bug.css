The CSS property `calc()` is not working as expected.  I'm trying to calculate the width of an element based on the viewport width, but it's not applying the calculation correctly.  Here's my code:

```css
#myElement {
  width: calc(100vw - 20px);
}
```

The element's width should be the viewport width minus 20 pixels, but it remains at its default width.
